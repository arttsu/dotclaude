Hi! Please read spec.org and implementation-notes.org to remember what we did in the scope of the current project.

I've prepared a code review for the changes, please see code-review-$ARGUMENTS.org

Please carefully review code review notes and relevant code.

For each code review note please provide feedback:

- if you agree with the note - tell me why
- if you partially agree - tell me why and suggest compromise
- if you disagree, and think that it's better to keep the current implementation - make an argument for it

Thanks!
