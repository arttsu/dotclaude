hi! please read 'spec.org' and let's implement this!
please keep notes/to-dos/findings in 'implementation-notes.org' file next to 'spec.org'

IMPORTANT: Follow these development principles:
1. **Tightly scope each step** - break down into small, verifiable units
2. **Prompt for validation** after each step before continuing
3. **Start with placeholders** - scaffold structure before implementing internals
4. **Add only "why" comments** - explain decisions, not what code does
5. **Make work verifiable** - add logging/tests to confirm behavior
6. **Check in frequently** - confirm approach before deep implementation

When creating your todo list, add explicit checkpoints like:
- "CHECKPOINT: Validate API structure with user"
- "CHECKPOINT: Confirm approach before implementation"
