hi! please read spec.org and implementation-notes.org
let's continue implementing this!

REMINDER: Follow these development principles from CLAUDE.md:
1. **Tightly scope each step** - break down into small, verifiable units
2. **Prompt for validation** after each step before continuing
3. **Start with placeholders** - scaffold structure before implementing internals
4. **Add only "why" comments** - explain decisions, not what code does
5. **Make work verifiable** - add logging/tests to confirm behavior
6. **Check in frequently** - confirm approach before deep implementation
7. Always keep **KISS** and **YAGNI** principles in mind!

When creating your todo list, add explicit checkpoints like:
- "CHECKPOINT: Validate API structure with user"
- "CHECKPOINT: Confirm approach before implementation"
